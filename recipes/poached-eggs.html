        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 organic eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep the water at a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Crack an egg into a small cup. Place cup near the surface of the hot water and gently drop egg into the water. Repeat with remaining eggs.
